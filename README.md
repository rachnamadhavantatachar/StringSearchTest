# StringSearchTest
JUnit Tests for testing - Java StringSearch Library By Johann Burkard

This project is to test the java stringsearch library - http://johannburkard.de/software/stringsearch/ using JUnit.
I have included the following testing methodologies to perform unit testing:-
1. Black Box Testing<br/>
   a. Equivalence Partition Tests
2. White Box Testing<br/>
   a. Ran code coverage using EclEmma (Java Coverage for Eclipse)
   b. Analyzed decision coverage & statement coverage and included tests to cover the missing scenarios.
3. Random Testing<br/>
   a. This testing methodology involves generating random strings & performing string search on the randomly generated string.
